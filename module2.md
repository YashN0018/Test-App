Connection: Module 1 → Module 2
Once a Client in Module 1 is converted from Lead to Active Client and the Business Understanding Dossier is Locked / TL Approved,
the system automatically unlocks Module 2: Commercials & Scope Finalization for that client.
Data carried forward:
•	ClientID (identity link)
•	AssignmentID (Pitch / Engagement starter)
•	Industry, StrategicInitiatives, and KeyRisks (used to pre-filter relevant scope items)
•	Approved PreparedBy, AssignedTL, and Partner roles (to set default access in Module 2)
When the client is activated:
•	A placeholder EffortEstimation record and ProposalDraft record are auto-created in “Not Started” status.
•	The UI presents a Commercials tab under the same engagement context.
Module 2 — Commercials & Scope Finalization
Core Purpose
Capture client requirements, estimate engagement effort, and generate the official Proposal, Engagement Letter, and Statement of Work from unified data sources.
________________________________________
Entities and Key Fields
ClientExpectation (ExpectationID)
Stores qualitative insights gathered during early meetings.
•	Linked ClientID and AssignmentID
•	ExpectationSummary (free text capturing compliance vs value-add and fee sensitivity)
•	CapturedBy, CapturedAt
•	LastReviewedBy, LastReviewedAt
•	Status (Draft / Finalized)
Behavior: Required before enabling Effort Estimator; acts as the contextual input for filtering master scopes.
________________________________________
EffortEstimation (EstimateID)
Quantifies estimated time and cost range for the assignment.
•	Linked AssignmentID / ClientID
•	TaskList / ProcessArea
•	EstimatedHours (per grade or task)
•	RateReference (pulled from Blanket Rates in MDM)
•	ComputedMinFee, ComputedMaxFee (range)
•	Comments / Assumptions
•	PreparedBy, ReviewedBy, ApprovedBy
•	Status (Draft / Reviewed / Approved)
Behavior: Operates as an independent analytical tab—values displayed to guide but not override manual fee decisions.
Logic: Fee = Rate × Hours. In v2.0, “Estimated Hours” will back-link to Actual Time Spent in Module 4 (Execution Tracker).
Validation: Partner approval required before Proposal generation.
________________________________________
ScopeSelection (ScopeID)
Represents chosen scope items derived from the firm-wide Master Scope List.
•	Linked ClientID / AssignmentID
•	MasterScopeRefIDs (list from MDM)
•	AppliedExpectationFilters (tags / keywords)
•	IncludedItems / ExcludedItems text blocks
•	PreparedBy, UpdatedAt
•	ApprovalStatus (Draft / UnderReview / Approved)
Behavior: Drives both internal and client-facing documents.
Filtering logic narrows the list of services by industry, risk area, or compliance vs value-add preference from the Client Expectation record.
________________________________________
ProposalDocument (ProposalID)
Holds generated proposals and their versioning.
•	Linked AssignmentID, ClientID, EstimateID, ScopeID
•	VersionNumber (v1, v2 ...)
•	ProposalName, PreparedBy, PreparedAt
•	FileLink (PDF)
•	ReviewStatus (Draft / Sent / Negotiation / Accepted / Rejected)
•	Remarks / NegotiationNotes
•	Hash (checksum for version integrity)
Behavior: Each save → auto-version (_v1, _v2 ...). Partner approval locks version and enables document generation.
________________________________________
EngagementLetter (ELID)
Formal client-facing contract merged from proposal and legal templates.
•	Linked ProposalID, ClientID, AssignmentID
•	TemplateVersion (from MDM)
•	Signatory / SignDate
•	FileLink (Final_EL.pdf)
•	Status (Draft / Signed / Archived)
Behavior: Generated by the Document Engine; once signed, updates Assignment.Status = “Signed EL” (which triggers Module 3 unlock).
________________________________________
StatementOfWork (SOWID)
Internal version of the engagement scope used by planning & execution teams.
•	Linked ProposalID, ScopeID, AssignmentID
•	SOWVersion (v1, v2 ...)
•	DetailedDeliverables, Milestones, ResourcesAllocated, FeeSplit, Assumptions
•	PreparedBy, ApprovedBy, ApprovalDate
•	FileLink (Internal_SOW.pdf)
Behavior: Generated simultaneously with the EL; stored internally; primary input to Modules 3 and 4.
Integrations & Data Flow
•	Inputs: Client record (from M1), Master Scope List & Blanket Rates (from MDM), user-entered expectations & hours.
•	Outputs:
o	Proposal_v1.pdf (client-facing)
o	Final_EL.pdf (signed contract)
o	Internal_SOW.pdf (internal reference)
o	Updated Assignment Metrics (Win/Loss ratio, total proposals count).
•	Connected Modules:
o	MDM: Reads templates, rates, and scope libraries.
o	Module 3 – Planning: Triggered by Signed EL; consumes SOW.
o	Module 4 – Execution Tracker: Future linkage for actual hours vs estimated.
o	Knowledge Hub: Stores all approved SOWs and final ELs for firm-wide search.
•	Notifications: TL/Manager/Partner receive alerts for pending approvals and version changes; post-signature notification to planning team.
